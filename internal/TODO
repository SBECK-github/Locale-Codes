Use Web::Scraper

o  Add 1<->many relationships
      code X1 in set 1 = A
      code X2 in set 1 = B
      code Y1 in set 2 = A,B
          code2code(X1) => Y1
          code2code(X2) => Y1
          code2code(Y1) => X1,X2
o  Add support for UTF-8
o  Read in first codes
   Second codes have code overlap (i.e. foo-alpha-2 overlaps alpha-2) to check
      for aliases
   Any name with UTF-8 has known substitutions (e' => e) and reports if any
      non-ASCII characters found

Add capabilites of
   Locale::Codes::Multilingual
   Locale::Country::Extra
including unicode, phone prefix


??? Make the name list and alias lists case sensitive.  RT 92680

Add regional codes including:
   MARC:  http://www.loc.gov/marc/countries/   Jarkko Hietaniemi

http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646
language tags (i.e. language [-script] [-region] [-variant]* [-extension]* [-privateuse]
   language :
     x-*
     i-*
     alpha-2 language code
     alpha-3 language code
     qaa-qtz-*
   region :
     alpha-2 country code
     UN M.49 code

Type: region   ISO 3166-1, UN M.49

=========

Create a new package:  Locale-Codes-Links
   links codes of one type to another
      NOT necessarily 1-to-1
   function:
      link(TYPE1 [CODESET1 [CODE1]] TYPE2 [CODESET2 [CODE2]])
         => ( LINK1, LINK2, ...)     all links between types

   TYPE = Language, Script, ...
   LINK = [ CODESET1,CODE1, CODESET2,CODE2 ]

   If all 6 pieces of information are given, returns 1 if the link exists.

   Locale::Codes::Links::Language-ExtLanguage
      links ExtLanguage to Language

Based on RT-61345:

   Add support for language subtags:
